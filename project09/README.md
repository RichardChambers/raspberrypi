## Raspberry Pi Starter Kit Lesson 12: Raspberry Pi Drive SG90 Servo

This lesson is at URL: http://osoyoo.com/2017/07/12/raspberry-pi-starter-kit-lesson-12-raspberry-pi-drive-sg90-servo/

The purpose of this lesson is to set up a circuit with the SG-90 servo motor in the kit
and rotate the motor shaft to a particular position.

The lesson on the Osoyoo web site mentions the use of a PCA9685 16-channel servo motor driver module
however this module is not included in the kit.

So we are going to use a different approach in which the Raspberry Pi will be driving the servo motor
which will be pulling its power from the 5.5v rail of the Pi. You can also use an alternative power
supply that provides 5.0v or a 4 AA or AAA battery pack

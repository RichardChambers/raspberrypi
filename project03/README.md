Raspberry Pi Starter Kit Lesson 6: Breathing LED

This project explores using the pwmWrite() function of the wiringPi library to make an LED pulse in brightness.

WARNING: The wiringPi library requires that a program that is manipulating the
PWM setting of GPIO#18 must be run with sudo. Not using sudo will result in
a number of weird behaviors including crash of the operating system.

Here is a 8 minute YouTube video that explains PWM and how it works with an LED:

## Using AMQP as a messaging protocol

In addition to CoAP and MQTT another major messaging protocol is AMQP which is supported
by RabbitMQ messaging broker.

It appears that a good staring point is the package `librabbitmq-dev` per this article
on Debian https://packages.debian.org/jessie/librabbitmq-dev

The easiest test environment seems to be to install RabbitMQ on a Linux machine to act as
a server.
